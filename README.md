First Week Challenge

# This project required that I change all non-descript div elements and change them to a more assessable and easier to read semantic format

I accomplished this by changing the top to a header, the middle section to an article, the right side to an aside, and the bottom to a footer. This will allow the next user to view the elements on the page easier and provide for easier updates in the future. None of the elements conflict with the CSS code as they all either were equiped with a class or id atribute. Furthermore, section elements can be found within the greater category of header, footer, aside etc.

# This project required that I add word text to images so that they may be rendered for the disabled

There were seven images in total. Six of which were found in the HTML code, all were provided appropiate and descriptive alts. The seventh, and last image, was found as a background image in the CSS code. The governing CSS code is linked to the .hero class atribute in the HTML code. I added a title element nested within the section code to provide an appropiate description.

# This project required that I add a concise and descriptive title

This title was found nested in the head element which simply read website. This was changed to provide a short, but concise description of the goals of the website, which is to provide an ehanced online pressence via the development and management of social media elements. The title "Social Media Management Services", being a full sentence rather than random terms, should come up in searches for company who wish to employ a company to manage their only social presence.
